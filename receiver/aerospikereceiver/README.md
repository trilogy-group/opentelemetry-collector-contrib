The Aerospike receiver is designed to collect performance metrics from one or
more Aerospike nodes. It uses the
[official Go client](https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go/tree/v5/)
to connect and collect.

Aerospike versions 4.9, 5.x, and 6.x are supported.


## Configuration

- `endpoint` (default localhost:3000)
- `collect_cluster_metrics` (default false): Whether discovered peer nodes should be collected
- `collection_interval` (default = 60s): This receiver collects metrics on an interval. Valid time units are ns, us (or Âµs), ms, s, m, h.
- `username` (Enterprise Edition only.)
